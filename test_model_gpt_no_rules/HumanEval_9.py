<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to implement rolling_max. The function takes a list of ints, returns list of same length where each element is max of numbers up to that index. Example: [1,2,3,2,3,4,2] -> [1,2,3,3,3,4,4]. Implementation straightforward. Need to include imports: from typing import List, Tuple. Also include docstring. Also include contract conditions. Use assert statements. Return list. Ensure correct. Also note that the function name is rolling_max. Use snake_case. Implementation. Also ensure that the function returns a new list. Use local variable. Also ensure that the function is defined. Also include the import. Also include the docstring. Also include the contract conditions.
